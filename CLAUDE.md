# CLAUDE.md — rendezvous-kit

TypeScript library for finding fair meeting points using isochrone intersection, venue search, and fairness scoring. Only runtime dependency is `geohash-kit` (ours). Zero third-party dependencies.

## Conventions

- **British English** everywhere — favour, colour, behaviour, licence, initialise, metre
- **Only dependency: geohash-kit (ours)** — uses its pointInPolygon, GeoJSON types, distance utilities
- **Git:** commit messages use `type: description` format. Do NOT include `Co-Authored-By` lines.
- **TDD:** write failing test first, then implement
- **ESM-only** with `.js` extensions in imports
- **TypeScript strict mode** — no `any`, no implicit returns
- **GeoJSON coordinates:** [longitude, latitude] (GeoJSON standard, NOT [lat, lon])

## Project structure

```
src/
  types.ts              — shared TypeScript interfaces
  geo.ts                — polygon operations (intersection, area, bbox, centroid)
  engines/
    openrouteservice.ts — ORS adapter (isochrone + matrix)
    valhalla.ts         — Valhalla adapter (isochrone + matrix)
    graphhopper.ts      — GraphHopper adapter (isochrone + matrix)
    osrm.ts             — OSRM adapter (matrix only, no isochrone)
  venues.ts             — Overpass API venue search
  rendezvous.ts         — findRendezvous pipeline (the main event)
  index.ts              — barrel re-export
```

## Build & test

```bash
npm run build      # tsc → dist/
npm test           # vitest run
npm run typecheck  # tsc --noEmit
npm run bench      # performance benchmarks
```

## Engine configuration

All engines are configured programmatically (no env vars) — pass URLs and keys to constructors:

| Engine | Required config | Notes |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| `ValhallaEngine` | `baseUrl` | Self-hosted or `https://routing.trotters.cc` (L402-gated) |
| `OpenRouteServiceEngine` | `apiKey` | Free key from openrouteservice.org/dev. `baseUrl` optional override |
| `GraphHopperEngine` | `baseUrl` | `apiKey` optional (needed for hosted GraphHopper) |
| `OsrmEngine` | `baseUrl` | Matrix only — no isochrone support |

Overpass venue search uses public endpoints by default. Pass `overpassUrl` to `searchVenues()` to override.

## Release & Versioning

**Automated via [forgesworn/anvil](https://github.com/forgesworn/anvil)** — `auto-release.yml` reads conventional commits on push to `main`, bumps the version, and creates a GitHub Release; `release.yml` then runs the pre-publish gates and publishes to npm via OIDC trusted publishing.

| Type | Version Bump |
|------|--------------|
| `fix:` | Patch (1.0.x) |
| `feat:` | Minor (1.x.0) |
| `BREAKING CHANGE:` (in commit body) | Major (x.0.0) |
| `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:` | None |

Tests must pass before release. **Work on branches** — merge to main only when a logical chunk is complete to avoid version spam.
